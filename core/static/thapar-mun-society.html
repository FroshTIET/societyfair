            <div class="society-des lead text-light">Model United Nations, also known as Model UN, is an unmatched experience where various committees and organs of the United Nations (UN) are simulated and participants can learn about diplomacy, international relations, and the United Nations. MUN involves and teaches participants speaking, debating, and writing skills, in addition to critical thinking, teamwork, and leadership abilities.

Thapar Model United Nations is one of the most prestigious MUN conferences in the country. With a legacy of 10 years, Thapar MUN Society prides itself in delivering an enriching experience of debate and dialogue in its 20 successful conferences. Backed with a proficient secretariat, the society offers a conference where the delegates gain an insight into the operations of the United Nations by actively participating in the resolution of critical global issues. 

In the course of an academic year, Thapar MUN Society conducts two MUN conferences: Thapar MUN Intra, which is confined to the students of Thapar Institute itself, providing the students with an introductory experience of a MUN, and Thapar MUN Inter, where students from all over the country participate and sharpen their debating, diplomacy, writing and artistic skills.

The participation in a Model United Nations, specifically in Thapar Model United Nations is not circumscribed merely to debaters and diplomats. Thapar Model United Nations recognizes the participation in the form of reporters/press members, debaters, caricaturists and photographers, thus covering the entire spectrum of skills and interests that the participants might possess. Both the MUN conferences are preceded by training sessions/workshops wherein the students are equipped with the methodology of performing in a MUN by the most experienced and accomplished members of the secretariat.

Thapar Model United Nations is the ultimate medium to prepare oneself for professional careers. It involves analysis and critical thinking which are imperative in the professional world. The members of the secretariat continuously strive to strategize the conferences in such a manner that the delegates embody the expertise in public speaking, research, writing and problem-solving skills. Thus, Thapar Model United Nations serves as the stepping stone towards professionalism, instilling social confidence in the students and preparing them for their career.

While one might consider MUN as a demanding and serious activity, the secretariat of Thapar MUN helps the students to get engulfed by the very essence of a MUN, making it an enjoyable experience. Thapar MUN Society goes beyond the confinements and provides a blended experience of fun and learning. The fun sessions between the debates, interaction with students from all around often inevitably leads to friendly competitiveness near the end of the conference.

Thapar Model United Nations is a delightful experience in itself, where the debates, deliberations and social interactions craft the overall persona of an individual. Thapar Model United Nations with an everlasting ideology of diplomacy with pragmatic opinions is continuously expanding its impacts to bring on the table the real crux of a MUN that engulfs the students in an extremely meaningful experience, leaving them with an insatiable desire for learning  more.
