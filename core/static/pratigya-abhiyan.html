Igniting minds and warming hearts
“The whole purpose of education is to turn mirrors into windows”
-Sydney J. Harris
Established 15 years ago, Pratigya Abhiyan is one of the most active societies at TIET, Patiala.
We collectively teach underprivileged children from various schools in Patiala and those of
fourth-class employees at TIET. Classes are held every day so that they can absorb maximum
knowledge from our volunteers. We teach kids from classes 1-12 and diploma classes. We also
teach different software skills to workers under our Adult Education Program with the aim to
uplift them. The children are provided with various resources such as books, stationary etc.
Along with education, many fun events are also held from time to time. In view of COVID-19
situation, we are teaching online.
Pratigya Abhiyan aims to create joyous, meaningful memories and give them enough exposure.
We are not just a team, we are a family of hard working and dedicated people, bound by a
common noble cause. Being a very empathetic society at its core, all the members help the
children selflessly through any problems that they face. This helps in the overall development of
children as well as the volunteers. Events throughout the year develop the volunteer’s
management, social and problem-solving skills.
Co-curricular activities are instrumental for drawing out the child’s best potential. So, we
organize diverse events such as art and dance competitions, sports day etc. from time to time to
encourage them to come out of their shells. UDAAN is our flagship annual event. We invite
parents to see their children perform in plays, dances and music on stage after a few weeks of
practice. Our other events include Movie Eve, Kite Flying etc.
This Abhiyan is an effort towards eradicating illiteracy and ultimately poverty in the society as a
whole. We strive to nurture the dreams and minds of the future generations of this country.
Volunteering is not just a simple word; it requires a lot of action too. We welcome you to take a
step and be a part of the change we aspire to bring in the society.
Serve the under-served, so that they find themselves in a better world.</p>
