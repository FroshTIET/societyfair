            <p class="society-des lead text-light">Thapar ACM Student Chapter is an elite technical society with one of the most active communities in Thapar. Under the guidance of the largest computing organisation, ACM, our vision is to create an environment for developing appropriate technical and non-technical skills and inculcate the spirit of teamwork amongst our members. We have always believed in the prospect of learning and growing together and so far, we have been quite successful in doing so, with some of our members being placed in prestigious companies like Microsoft, Cisco, DRDO, JP Morgan, etc.

At Thapar ACM, we have been conducting classes every week covering almost all the fundamentals in the world of programming. Be it competitive programming or development, we are leaving no stones unturned. Starting from scratch to all the way to the top and instilling a habit of learning by doing amongst our members by involving them in the development of various impactful projects. 
One such marvelous project by our members is "Samadhaan" which aimed to log and solve the complaints of the residents of Palwal District by providing a platform to both the citizens and authorities where their voices can be heard. 

Our efforts have borne fruitful results too with two of our members, Prakarsh Jain and Shivam Goel clearing ICPC- world's biggest competition for competitive programming. Not only this, one of our members Sahil Batra who got placed in Microsoft, grabbed the highest package in Thapar in the year 2020. Our members have also been bringing laurels in the department of research as one of our members, Harshveer Singh's research paper on "BatchNorm and second order properties of loss surface" recently got published in ICTACT 2020.

So are YOU up for taking yourself to the next level? Are you ready to expand your horizons and learn from the best? Then, come join us in our journey full of joy and more importantly, learning. Come be a part of Thapar ACM. See you soon.</p>
