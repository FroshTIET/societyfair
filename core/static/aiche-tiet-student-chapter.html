            <div class="society-des lead text-light">AIChE –
AMERICAN INSTITUTE OF CHEMICAL ENGINEERS. THE GLOBAL HOME FOR ALL THE BUDDYING CHEMICAL ENGINEERING BRAINS.
AIChE is the world's leading organization for chemical engineering professionals, with more than 60,000 members from more than 110 countries. AIChE has the breadth of resources and expertise you need whether you are in core process industries or emerging areas, such as translational medicine. It offers you technical information and programming for AIChE’s technical meetings, plus recognition to outstanding chemical engineers in their area of expertise. They also provide opportunities for affiliation with top engineers in the general disciplines as well as in emerging fields like chemical, industrial engineering as well as biotechnology. This classification of chemical branch provides engineering students with best possible knowledge of each and every division, so that they can focus themselves in the right direction. AIChE will boost your technical aspects and provide you quick thinking skills by involving you one of the best technical events i.e. Chem-E-Car and Chem-E-Jeopardy. Chem-E-Car Competition is an annual college competition for students majoring in Chemical Engineering. According to the competition's official rules, students must design small-scale automobiles that operate by chemical means, along with a poster describing their research. Chem-E-Jeopardy is a quizzing competition which is somewhat based on a popular TV reality show. This event is one of the flagship events of AIChE. The questions asked in this competition covers a wide range of knowledge not only of chemical engineering but of various branches of Engineering. Chemical engineering is applied chemistry. It is the branch of engineering concerned with the design, construction, and operation of machines and plants that perform chemical reactions to solve practical problems or make useful products. AIChE acts as a binding agent for engineers and helps in providing all the possible exposure and knowledge. Students get to interact and share technical stuff at global level, with all the intellectual brains in the respective fields.
