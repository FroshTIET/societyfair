            <p class="society-des lead text-light">“This world demands the qualities of youth: not a time of life but a state of mind, a temper of the will, a quality of imagination, a predominance of courage over timidity, of the appetite for adventure over the love of ease.” — Robert Kennedy.

Youth United, a committee driven by and for the youngsters of our college. Youth are the major stake holders of our population, empowering them and making them realize their responsibilities towards social causes of our country is a must. We focus on bringing forward different individuals and working together as a team in providing our society with our noble services. We aim in channelizing our efforts into meaningful and measurable public welfare events and projects that we organize every year.

"A person's most useful asset is not a head full of knowledge, but a heart full of love, an ear ready to listen and a hand willing to help others."

Every year we recruit our college youngsters and we together organize and conduct number of events with the target to provide and support our community with essential resources. 
To start with, Daan Utsav which is commonly known as JOY OF GIVING week, is India’s ‘festival of giving’. It is celebrated every year on Gandhi Jayanti – from October 2 to 8. During this week, millions of people from all walks of life come together to give their time, money, resources, or skills back to society. We, Team Youth United conduct series of events throughout this week with the motive to provide and donate in different ways possible. This Utsav is commenced with an opening ceremony titled as “OPEN MIC AND INFORMALS” that also includes many fun activities for the audience. The following days, charitable and public-spirited events namely, PULSES and VASTRA DAAN, STATIONARY DAAN, SEVA SANDWICH, HYGIENE CAMP, MEDICAL CAMP and WISH TREE are organized by the team with great zest and zeal.

SMILING FUTURE, the second event of the year, isorganized by our team to bring forward the gems, The Differently Abled Children, of our society. A platform to showcase their talents and artsy minds. A painting competition and a talent show are conducted to bring out the virtuosity of the children that makes them no different than the rest of us. This effort of ours is to provide them with opportunities, encouragement and support in the best way we can. 
And lastly the online event, UNITEUP, through which we share the different experiences and stories of people helping the underprivileged in many ways. An opportunity for the students to get featured on our Instagram page by sharing a few pearls from their treasured memories with tales of smiles & laugshter. 
YOUTH UNITED as a whole moves towards encouraging the development of the society. We aim to do our best and bring smiles on the faces around us. With one goal in mind; to do our part in making the world a better place for all.
