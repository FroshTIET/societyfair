            <h1 class="text-center text-light main-title">Thapar Food Festival</h1>
            <div class="society-des lead text-light">Thapar food festival (TFF) is a spectacular fiesta organized by TIET, Patiala. Our main aim is to provide a diverse variety of flavours to attendants in a mesmerizing ambience. It is one of a kind festival and the very first to be organized by an Indian university. In association with grand sponsors and exquisite vendors, TFF presents a perfect medley of flavours and cuisines from all over India and even abroad. Some of our past sponsors include Coca-Cola, Swiggy, Nestle, Pizza-Hut, Keventors, Uncle Jacks and Burger king. 
Thapar Food Festival organises numerous events loaded with happiness and countless flavours. First in this list is Orientation which gives an insight into the Thapar Food Festival accompanied by a bunch of surprises. Following orientation there is Dine-Out. Dine-out is a tour which brings the authentic taste of the royal city on your platter. This unique event is especially for first-year students so that they can interact with their peers as well as know about the famous eateries of the city. Then the ultimate battle of Food takes place known as Man vs Food. It is a chance for all true foodies to show their eternal love for food and win the battle of food by eating most at renowned food joints of the city. 
 For what can be better therapy than a healthy dose of unabashed humour?  Food and comedy are the universal means of communication and we believe in bringing both together. For fulfilling this purpose Thapar Food Festival organises Food Comedy where you can get culinary tips from the chef itself. To hold the crown of a chef is no simple task. A Cook-Off challenge is also organised by Thapar Food Festival which tests the teams’ ability to become “Chefs for A Day”. The fun and excitement of the program is no doubt the biggest draw.
Finally, the most awaited food event of the year arrives which is the Main day. 50+ food stalls packed with more than 200+ luscious dishes from all around the globe. Ranging from sweet to waffles to succulent kebabs, you can experience the magnificent blend of different flavour accompanied by great ambience and happiness.
Some of our past achievements include creating a new Guinness World record. Thapar Food Festival in a grand association with Coca-cola made a successful attempt at breaking the Guinness World record of opening a maximum number of Coca-Cola cans. This was made possible because of a crowd of 2000 participants filled with enthusiasm to enter a book filled with renowned names.
The "exchange for a change" campaign was another impactful initiative took by Thapar Food Festival with an aim to spread awareness amongst the students regarding environment protection. Under this campaign, we managed to collect more than 50K plastic bottles from different schools and colleges of Patiala.
Thapar Food Festival gives you an opportunity to create tons of memories with your friends and guarantees you a true heavenly food experience.</div>
