            <p class="society-des lead text-light">“VIRSA-The Essence of Punjab” aims at keeping people connected to one of the oldest and richest cultures of the world-our VIRSA, our Punjabi culture, which has a very great history and complexity. This glorious culture shows its diversity, exuberance, and rich heritage including various fields like poetry, philosophy, spirituality, education, artistry, music, cuisine, science, technology, military warfare, architecture, traditions, values, and history. Virsa is known for its luxuriousness and lavishness. Our robust yet folk festivals collectively form a vivacious base for enlightening the social verve.“VIRSA” is not just a society, but a fest and a month-long celebration. It is named as the best college fest to attend in the whole of Punjab. We organize a number of events which are as follows:
ORIENTATION:
Orientation encompasses a brief introduction of the society (Virsa-The Essence of Punjab). Heads and core members interact with the freshers.
VIRSA TALKS:
Our pre-fest VIRSA TALKS showcases magnificent interactions with many eminent and influential personalities. The esteemed panel of speakers inspires the youth with their experience and guidance.
INFORMAL AND JAAGO:
VIRSA extends INFORMALS as a social recreation which portrays the traditional games of Punjab. After the fervent participation in sports, VIRSA officially declares the commencement of the main events with a traditional ceremony of JAAGO. The zeal and high-spirits of the students shine in their eyes brighter that starts and lights.
SHAAM E VIRAASAT:
An eve which takes you on a journey through the culture of Punjab. It is an event that is talked about and awaited the entire year. Students from outside Punjab enthusiastically wait to witness and participate in the portrayal of this rich culture. The enthusiasm for this event starts from the moment the stage is set up in the OAT. The creativity put on the stage makes sure to create a traditional and ambient vibe. It offers you an extensive array of events ranging from the vigorous Bhangra to the subtle traditional Giddha. Soulful cultural music mesmerizes every onlooker. Judges enjoy the event as they critique it and are honored with mementos. 
VIRSA MELA:
Then comes our flagship event the “Virsa Mela” which lets you enjoy what a traditional fair is to the core. It offers you a number of stalls, dances like Malwai gidha, bhangra, etc, Punjabi Dhaba food to relish and enjoy. There are stunts, creative cultural photo booths, etc to watch. It is an evening full of vigor yet sophistication when everyone enjoys being in their cultural attire. 
GURPURAB:
The ecstatic journey comes to an end with seeking the blessings of Guru Nanak Dev Ji on his Prakash Gurpurab. Esteemed Ragis leave everyone spellbound with the melodious intoning of hymns, followed by Guru Ka Langar.

VIRSA tries to serve as an open platform where students can exhibit and polish their non-technical, technical, and creative capabilities. Students get divided into various departments like creativity, content, design, marketing, etc. Each department works according to its purpose and gives the students an experience to grab all the opportunities the world offers. Along the journey, many members develop new capabilities and discover new talents amongst themselves.
 
 To commemorate our long lost culture, we not only believe in keeping our traditions in practice but in reinforcing all our Gurus’ teachings in our lives once again. With the determination and courage that all our warriors have displayed, we aim at working towards a drug-free and alcohol-free society. We aim at eradicating all the evils which weaken our society and our glorious culture. Our driving force for the future will be the will to prevent the youth from falling on the wrong track of alcohol, drugs, violence, etc. The modernity of yesterday is the tradition of today and the modernity of today will be the tradition of tomorrow and we want to leave no stone unturned to give modernity and culture worth remembering and gratifying.</p>
