            <h1 class="text-center text-light main-title">GirlUp TIET</h1>
            <p class="society-des lead text-light">Girl Up makes a difference in the lives of girls around the world, empowering their communities near and far. Our Girl Up community will provide a platform and guide girls along their journey from leader to changemaker with specialized programming in organizing, advocacy, fundraising, and communications. The International Girl Up platform exposes girls to issues at the intersection of gender equality and sports, storytelling, and more. We will position girls to be leaders across industries where women are underrepresented. When girls take part in Girl Up programs, they experience higher self-confidence, compassion, empathy, social collaboration and civic participation.
When life returns back to the campus, our team will start organising offline workshops and webinars. Inviting strong female mindsets to motivate the students and faculty of our college. Women empowerment is a mindset and an attitude, it needs to be showcased on a college level for the entire community to understand its true essence. Our campaigns will not only target female mindsets but also the stereotypical male attitude towards such initiatives. We will tackle themes such as Women Empowerment through Entrepreneurship and Corporate Leadership, Gender Sensitisation, Sanitation, Hygiene, the Gender Binary and many other relevant issues. Our club will conduct workshops and seminars regarding these subjects and issues in our college and in nearby schools. Meanwhile focusing on creating interactive and educational content to raise awareness, as well as in depth explanations of these aforementioned topics and analyses of policies regarding the same. 
Through GirlUp we also have a responsibility to reach out to neighbouring schools and potentially backward areas. Clubs in Delhi have partnered with the local police to conduct self defence workshops in government primary schools, this is an idea we also want to do. Sanitation and Hygiene/ Good Touch Bad Touch/ Domestic Violence etc workshops to be conducted in as many primary schools as we can reach out to. The long-term goal is not only to create an impact in our college but in the neighbourhood. </p>
