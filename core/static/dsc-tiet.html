            <div class="society-des lead text-light">Greetings, young-lings, we welcome you to Thapar, and we hope you strive to achieve excellence in this magnificent institute, which vows to do its best to provide you with the environment, the peers and the resources to grow as an individual into a capable and mighty engineer. Developer Student Club, Thapar is a group of disciples of the free and open source philosophy, inspired by our ancestors who advocated for freedom in software and cyberspace, and our contemporaries in the Google Developers' Family. We aim to provide the institution, the nation, and even humanity with some very useful solutions to some very demanding problems in the form of free and open source software, as all software should be. Our projects boast to be some of the best projects that students of this institute have ever written, including but not limited to: 

A collection of bots for slack channels which serve information about our events, and articles and blogs from various sources online
A platform for students to buy and sell items within the campus, our very own and home-grown OLX
A tool for fact-checking and validating news articles automagically
A translator between spoken, written, and sign languages for the differently abled

With the assistance of Google Developers, we are proud to have contributed our bit in the vast plethora of free and open source code publicly released by an uncountable number of developers across the globe, and pledge to continue to do so, because the more open and free the digital world is, the better it is for every user and programmer alike. We vow to never stray from our philosophy and goal, which is to provide others with efficient and quality-code, and our members with a hands-on experience with how software is developed in the industry, and how to collaborate with other people to contribute to software.

Among our ranks stands the highest order of elite coders of the institution, with an abundance of young talent looking to follow and fill these testing shoes. We conduct workshops which are hard to leave without having an insightful eye opened, hackathons where you will lose yourself in the cacophony of code, and talks inspiring enough to breathe the fresh air of creativity onto your CPU heat-sinks. We bid you a very warm welcome to this institution, and extend an invitation for one and all to come explore this wonderful world of open source.
