            <h1 class="text-center text-light main-title">Thapar Toastmasters Club</h1>
            <div class="society-des lead text-light">Toastmasters International, is a world leader in communication and leadership development. The organization has more than 352,000 members globally. We, at Thapar Toastmasters Club, cater good learners over good speakers because we firmly believe in learning and achieving together. This is one of the key aspects of the club, where amateur speakers enter and leave as professional public speakers, who can enthral audience with their eloquence. Our club is built upon the fundamental core values of integrity, respect, service and excellence. Toastmasters is a platform that gives you exactly what you want out of it. Following the norms of Toastmasters International, the club holds meetings on a weekly basis. Club members take up roles a week prior to the meeting through our club application (an android software). These roles include Toastmaster of the day (TMOD) who chairs the meeting, speakers who deliver speeches, evaluators, table topic masters and other auxiliary roles. Moreover, even in times like these when our lives are restricted to virtual windows, we’ve kept our spirits high and conducted more than fifteen successful online meetings. 

At Thapar Toastmasters, we have always strived to make sure that maximum number of people get to know what the organisation is all about and how Toastmasters helps them in becoming better world leaders. Therefore, every year, we hold Cogitation workshop for five days in the proem week, which has always proved to be a memorable experience both for our team and for the freshers. Through this, we’ve always been successful in providing fundamentals of public speaking and leadership to the budding speakers through our interactive and innovative activities. Hence, we’ve influenced our audience to take a step forward in their professional journey. Cogitation is filled with fun-filled and mind-boggling events and activities which help the freshers overcome their stage fright. Apart from the cogitation week, we hold a Showcase Meeting completely dedicated to freshers. The showcase meeting is designed with the objective of briefing the prospective members about how a Toastmasters club functions and how the club proceedings are carried out. The idea is to carry out a normal Toastmasters club meeting in front of a large audience of prospective members who would like to join the club.

Speech contests are an important part of the Toastmasters educational program. They provide an opportunity for Toastmasters to gain speaking experience, as well as an opportunity for others in order for the Toastmasters to learn by observing proficient speakers. The International Speech and Table Topic Contest makes its way from the Club, Area, Division and District level to the WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP OF PUBLIC SPEAKING.

Apart from the weekly meeting sand contests, club holds inter and intra institution events annually. Some of them being Toast Talks, Toast Tussle, Toast Trials etc. The sole motive to conduct these events is to provide a platform where young minds come together to explore, think and study real world problems. Toast Talks is an annual flagship competition, where aspiring young speakers from the entire college, as well as other clubs compete to be crowned as the ‘THE BEST PUBLIC SPEAKER’. The club issues an annual newsletter “The Communique” displaying annual achievements and nuances of the club. Founded six years ago, Thapar Toastmasters Club has come a long way, developing leaders. We envision ourselves to be committed to this goal and continue with the same.
