Thapar Institute of Engineering and Technology, 
Patiala 
In past 10 years of assiduous and orderly building on the foundation of ‘Seeing the world with an economic lens’, Econ club has always strived for excellence. 

We aim to inspire an understanding and application of economic concepts in day to day life among college students who realize the immense importance and practical relevance of this field in the complex world. 

The team has made sure to come up with some good and concrete ideas with every passing year whether it is IPL/UEFA auctions for cricket/football enthusiasts or The Wolf of Dalal Street for individuals who love rolling money in the stock market. With the help of a dedicated team we have been able to carry our legacy through these years and organise many successful events."STRATAGEM" the annual economic fest (Since 2017) aims at providing participants an elusive world of economics and finance as they participate in various fin-tech events where they get to brainstorm and exchange ideas among each other. Attended by around thousand participants from different colleges and backgrounds, it is the perfect blend of technical aspects in non-technical concept. "For good ideas and true innovation, you need human interaction, conflict, argument and debate” The flagship event of Stratagem "Thapar Economic Summit" provides a platform where political perspectives and personalities come together to discuss the dynamics of Indian/ Global Economy. Cashless clans, based on Barter system, an ancient concept yet formed the basis of an amusing event. Similarly Vyapaar, an event that puts one’s entrepreneurial abilities at test and Witty Planners puts one’s business temperament at use. This is just a glimpse of the three day long saga, awaited by everyone. Balance of deliberations, discussions, quick wits and intellectual thinking provide dimensions to these events.

So look forward to the rich endeavours while a whole new world inspired by economics awaits you. We believe that becoming financially stable is much more about saving and investing in the right manner than earning tonnes of money!

"Alone we can do so little; together we can do so much." The ECON team consists of core and executive members whose relentless work builds the foundation of our success. We work in an environment which promotes an atmosphere that fosters friendship and loyalty. We believe that everyone must choose teamwork over personal ambition. We work together toward a common vision. This gives us the ability to direct individual accomplishments toward organizational objectives. It is the fuel that allows our team to attain astonishing results. We at ECON firmly believe that the strength of the team is each individual member and the strength of each member is the team. With our teamwork, we aspire to create dream work!

From economy enthusiasts to finance fanatics, web designers and developers to writers and speakers, there's room for everyone in the ECON family. We believe that with persistency and consistency success will follow. Turn your losses into profit and incur a plethora of knowledge on the way. Enhance your social skills and build your contacts. If you have a zeal to learn, a passion for economics and a hunger for excellence, the ECON club calls for your exuberance. After a successful journey through college, it will be ECON which would make saying goodbye so hard.</p>
