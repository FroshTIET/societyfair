            <p class="society-des lead text-light">Thirty years ago, the potentially disruptive impact of heat-trapping emissions from burning fossil fuels and rain forests became front-page news. In the time it took to build the case that climate change is a pollution problem, itâ€™s become unnervingly more than that. Coming back to 2020, climate change is still an insidious problem that fails to be taken seriously. Zooming in, even more, coming to the local level, because that's how it matters and that's how it needs to be addressed, Thapar Institute of Engineering & Technology, Patiala prides itself over a lush green campus which is the legacy the Paryavaran Welfare Society aims to constantly create. Paryavaran Welfare Society is the perfect place to start working towards the environment, give it what it has always sought and deserved, care, and love. We are a Non Profit Society that aims to take up the issues of the environment and address them in our own small yet profoundly powerful way. The environment needs all the help and care it can get, so do we, but we also promise a newfound skill set that includes overcoming your social fears and realizing that tending to the GREEN doesn't make you any less. 

We conduct plenty of events throughout the academic year, ranging from Plantations, Vehicular Pollution Check camps, Cleanliness Drives, Annual Diwali event to our annual flagship event Econigma which has enjoyed a lot of success in recent years. We are a low effort society and would never ask our members to prioritize the society over their academics. Our events promise to magically vanish your social fears, stage fear, and responsibility phobia. Last year, we went out and planted 500 trees on campus, which had never been done before. Our 'fresher' members get to be called the Executive Members of the society under the constant guidance of their seniors on the Core team. Responsibility is gradually handed over to the executive members after they have seen and learned from their seniors what it takes. The thing we pride ourselves on the most is that we are not just a society, we are a family that nurtures and cares for each other. The legacy our seniors left behind is picked up by the successors and multiplied several folds. We remain as tightly knitted as the roots of the strongest trees on campus and beyond.

So, apply now and become a part of a society that cares for things beyond just ourselves but the members end up learning a plethora of skills and confidence that will remain with you for the rest of your life.
