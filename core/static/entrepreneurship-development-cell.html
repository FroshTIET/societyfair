The three words we, the Entrepreneurship Development Cell, have thrived by in our journey over the years. Being the only Entrepreneurship Cell of Thapar, we strive hard to shape the next generation of entrepreneurs for their journey. With exciting and insightful events throughout the year, we provide students with experiences to remember and bonds to cherish.  
EDC is the official E-Cell of Thapar. Being part of the E-Cell of any college is a unique experience to have. You stand out from your peers, with the exposure of a vast cross-nation family of interconnected E-Cells, who you get the opportunity to work with and learn skills from the best in the fields of tech, marketing, finance, content, and designing, helping you build a significant network of your own in little time.
A year has 365.25 days, we don't recommend waste a single one of them sitting around. So, we bring to you, Pitchers, one of the most awaited events of the year, as we bring to you an opportunity to polish your pitching skills in front of an esteemed panel of judges. Our mega-flagship event E-Summit is a 3-day entrepreneurial extravaganza.  We kick-started our E-Summit this year with Unwind- The Informal Eve, where the famous web series Kota Factory’s cast joined us for a mesmerizing and memorable experience. This caravan continued on the next day with “Elevate-The Business Lab”- An adrenaline-filled competition where competitors showed their skills to manage resources and crisis as a perfect entrepreneur. 
This was followed by a Women Entrepreneurship Panel, with YouTubers like Kirti Mehra, Pratishtha Sharma, and entrepreneurs like Suditi Jindal, sharing their insights in a fun-filled session.  On the final day, the biggest formal event of TIET, the Internship fair was organized which was graced by the presence of 20+ companies as they provided the young minds an opportunity to intern with them in tech as well as non-tech fields. 
Nobody saw the pandemic coming and neither did we, but adapting is what entrepreneurship is all about so to cater to this we started E-talks where today’s leading Entrepreneurs like Jugnoo’s CEO-Samar Singla, OYO’s Director International Business-Sudeep Gupta, and Director at OLA-Satyam Manohar joined us to share their insights, experiences, and wisdom on global industrial issues.
We also hold various opportunities like Venture Labs, where you get to learn about dealing with investors and angel firms, and the state-wide accredited Start-up Expo, where you get to compete with other start-ups in a chance to win 50,000 cash reward, in a bid to support and encourage budding Entrepreneurs along with a strategic partnership with the Science and Technology Entrepreneur Park (STEP) to provide young start-ups with incubation and mentorship for support in the initial phases.
