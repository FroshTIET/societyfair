            <p class="society-des lead text-light">Ideate, Ascend, and Lead.
The three words we, the Entrepreneurship Development Cell, have thrived by in our journey over the years.
Being the only Entrepreneurship Cell of Thapar, we strive hard to shape the next generation of entrepreneurs for their journey.
With exciting and insightful events throughout the year, we provide students with experiences to remember and bonds to cherish. 

Why EDC??
EDC is the official E-cell of Thapar. Being part of the E-cell of any college is a unique experience to have. You stand out from your peers, with the exposure of a vast cross-nation family of interconnected E-cells, who you get the opportunity to work with and learn skills from the best in the fields of tech, marketing, content, and designing, helping you build a significant network of your own in little time.

What events do you experience throughout the year?
A year has 365.25 days, why waste a single sitting around

Pitchers, one of the most awaited events by freshers, as it is an opportunity to polish your pitching skills in front of an esteemed panel of judges. 

Our mega-event  awaited for by the entire college, E-Summit, is a 3 day-long phenomenon. 
Developing and polishing new skills is important, but all work and no play, what kind of college life is that? We kick-started our E-SUMMIT this year with UNWIND- The Informal Eve, where the famous web series Kota Factory’s cast and Keshav Sadhna joined us for a mesmerizing and memorable experience.

This caravan continued on the next day with “Elevate-The Business Lab”- An adrenaline-filled competition where competitors showed their skills to manage resources and crisis as a perfect entrepreneur. 
This was followed by a Women Entrepreneurship Panel, with YouTubers like Kirti Mehra, Pratishtha Sharma, and entrepreneurs like Suditi  Jindal, sharing their insights in a fun-filled session. 
On the final day, the biggest formal event of TIET, the Internship fair was organized which was graced by the presence of 20+ companies as they provided the young minds an opportunity to intern with them in tech as well as non-tech fields.

Nobody saw the pandemic coming and neither did we, but adapting is what entrepreneurship is all about so to cater to this we started E-talks where today’s leading Entrepreneurs like Jugnoo’s CEO-Samar Singla, OYO’s Director International Business-Sudeep Gupta joined us to share their insights, experiences, and wisdom on global industrial issues.

Idle minds are the most creative ones and to cater to this we held various online quizzes, workshops, and competitions with our event Hawkeye, which is a grand success, with the significant crowd from outside college.

We also hold various opportunities like Venture Labs, where you get to learn about dealing with investors and angel firms and the statewide accredited Startup Expo, where you get to compete with other startups in a chance to win 50,000 cash reward, in a bid to support and encourage budding Entrepreneurs along with a strategic partnership with the Science and Technology Entrepreneur Park (STEP) to provide young startups with incubation and mentorship for support in the initial phases.
