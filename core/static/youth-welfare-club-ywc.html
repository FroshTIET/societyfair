Every year during Navratri days that is the festive season when there are celebrations all around when all the students are
excited about festivals and somehow starts missing their homes and families our society organizes Jagran to give them
homelike warmth and feel. The whole Thapar is lighted with beautiful shimmery and bright lights of different hues. Our
team decorates the OAT with beautiful lights and the crops made by the team. Beautiful rangoli is made by the team to
welcome all the people. The stage is set up with vibrant coloured tents and a big alluring idol of Goddess Durga and other
Gods and Goddesses as well. There are happiness and excitement everywhere. Before starting the Jagran all the
students, faculty members including honourable DOAA Sir, staff workers as well as their children are served Navratri
special meal. After the meal, the Jagran begins and lasts till the morning. Everyone is dressed up in ethnics and the whole
ambience looks very colourful.
“Take care of your body. It’s the only place you have to live”-Jim Rohn. While keeping in mind about the mental health and
fitness of the students we organize Yoga session in which professional yoga tutors are specially called to proceed the
session. Many students and faculty members participate in this session to get the peace of mind and the calmness in
this busy schedule of life.</div>
