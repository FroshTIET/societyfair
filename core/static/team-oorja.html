            <h1 class="text-center text-light main-title">Team Oorja</h1>
            <p class="society-des lead text-light">Team Oorja comprises of a group of staunch individuals passionate about their craft. The team founded in 2015 by Bhanu Marwaha comprised of 12 members under the able guidance of Dr. Gagandeep Kaur. In a short span of time the column of achievements has grown profusely.
The team started its venture with the EFFI Cars electric competition (2016) where the team proved their wit by designing and fabricating an electric vehicle completely by themselves and thereby winning the Best Design Award in the competition Effi Cars 2016, held at UIET Chandigarh. 
In 2017-2018 the team designed and fabricated a Go-kart for G.K.D.C- 2018 held at Kari Motor Speedway (Coimbatore) where teams participated from all over the country. The team performed well with being placed at an all India rank of 27th out of over 190 teams and the fabricated vehicle had the 2nd best acceleration in line-up. In 2018-2019 the team scaled and dominated the G.K.D.C- 2018 held at Buddh international Circuit (Greater Noida) with complete authority with over 192 teams participating from the starting day. Despite there being a healthy competition from other college teams like NIT Surat and IET Lucknow, our team made a significant mark thereby having a red-letter day. The number of accolades earned by the team include: Overall Runner Up, Autocross- 1st, Best Driver Award: SHIVAM PANWAR, and Best Business Plan Apart from these trophies, we also gained good positions in other events that didnâ€™t involve a trophy or a prize but did play role while accumulating the marks for the final rankings. These include securing: First position in cost report, third position in endurance, second position in engineering design, second in acceleration, first position in final line-up and third position in disassembly and assembly. Team Oorja with a vision to implement electrification of passenger and commercial vehicles has embarked upon this jewel of a project under the complete financial support of Experiential Learning Centre at Thapar. The common vision and interests of Dr. Sanjeev Bedi (Visiting professor- University of Waterloo) and Team Oorja has made this project a reality and the first phase of electrification is completed. Team is currently presenting T.I.E.T. in Quad Torc 2020 Competition and also working on the Autonomous Jeep project. The team also aims to make an all-girls team for women empowerment.</p>
