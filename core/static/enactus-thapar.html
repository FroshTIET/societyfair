            <div class="society-des lead text-light">Enactus is one of the shinning crowns in the international student community, working on social Enterprenuel projects, focused towards improving the world we live in and Enactus Thapar serves as an important jewel of this crown.
Having worked year after year with our dedicated team of talented individuals, we proved our glory at the national level this year by reaching the semi-final stage of Enactus Nationals, beating 150+ Enactuses from around the nation, making us one of the top 20 in the country.
We also proved our community outreach at the National level by finishing among the top six most viewed as well as most voted social media channels at Enactus National cup.
We also brought laurels, as winners of E-Summit organized by IIT Roorkee and runners-up at the National Social summit.
Here we present to you some of the projects that we have undertaken to make our nation a better version of itself.
Paddy Waste Management- One of the largest projects undertaken by any student organization in the region, this project is focused to subdue the burning of paddy waste after harvest season in the states of Haryana as well as Punjab. 
Naritva- While the world has reached the second decade of the 21st century, women's menstrual hygiene continues to remain a taboo topic among most in our society. We aim to raise awareness in rural and urban communities about the significance of using Biodegradable Sanitation Pads, with the development and distribution of the same.
Entracer- As the world fought hard to find ways to track and isolate infected people in the COVID times, we managed to come up with our own contact tracing system to ensure that the number of people that can be infected is to a minimum.
We along with fellow team delta developed a device that can check an individual's vitals such as temperature while providing sanitization services to limit the spread of COVID on campus premises.
Grameen- While farmers have suffered at the hands of the deadly virus, this project is focused to help farmers in the region shift to precision farming to reduce the money that they spend on fertilizers.
Khadyan- Along with Grameen, khadyan is focused to help farmers to shift to organic farming by providing organic manure at a cheaper rate.

All work and no fun isn't a good recipe for success. So, we organize a number of activities throughout the year.

The Annual Diwali event, Deepotsav ’19, generated funds through selling Diyas. It featured an Open-Mic to attract the crowds. The Diyas and most materials were brought from local roadside sellers in Patiala. All the funds received were given back to the local selling community of Patiala.

Pride week was a week-long cultural extravaganza organized by Enactus Thapar to mark the pride month, organized from 18th to 26th June. It marked a strong effort from us to open the conversation upon the still taboo topic of the LGBTQ+ community, as it featured talks, panel discussions from prominent members of the LGBTQ+ community with the support of NGOs and other Enactus from North India.

Métier: The Case Study Competition was organized to to help students locked up in homes tackle with the new realities of self-isolation.
