<li><strong>About literary society</strong>
<em>“In the long run, a people is known, not by its statements or its statistics, but by the stories it tells.”</em> –Flannery O’Connor
Human beings are story-telling animals and the study of literature confronts us with the richness of human experiences; helping us to appreciate common values and the differences between those experiences across cultures, places, and times. Literature shows the design of the creative process, allowing us to interpret the deep motivations of human minds and societies—both in the past and today.
As one of the founding societies in Thapar University, we’ve had a long journey, and a legacy of people behind us who have not only shaped the society to what it is today but, also have given us a path to continue and better upon. 
<em>We at the core are a community of people passionate about Literature and Arts</em>, <em>piloted by</em> an eclectic notion of avant-garde ideas. 
As a group, we aim to bring together students from multiple disciplines with an interest in Literature, Cognitive Thinking, Discourse and Performing Arts, reflecting the interests of undergraduates, graduate, and associate members alike. For that we hold special events such as readathons, talks, screenings, shows, literature in performing arts, the fine arts, the social sciences, politics, and culture.</li>
</ol>
<p>Literary Society at Thapar is the amalgamation of 8 sub-socs, namely:</p>
<ol>
<li>Muse</li>
