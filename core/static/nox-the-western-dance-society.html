            <p class="society-des lead text-light">If you know Thapar, you've got to know NOX. 
NOX is Thapar University's Western dance society, established in 2007. The society actively participates in college fests held throughout India and performs for the major events held within the college as well. Some of our achievements include:
•	MOOD INDIGO ,IIT BOMBAY (2019) : Runners Up
•	OASIS, BITS PILANI (2019): Winner
•	PECFEST (2019): Winner
•	ZEITGEIST,IIT ROPAR(2018): Winner
•	ALGORYTHM,CHITKARA (2018):Winner
•	PECFEST(2018): Runners up
              And many more…….

We represent a strong dynamic team of dancers on stage, however, we are a close-knit family offstage. Being extremely supportive of each other, motivating one another and staying together throughout is our functioning methodology.
Apart from participation in events outside college NOX holds its annual event 'NOX-NITE', in February which attracts the entire college and leaves everyone mesmerized by our energetic, captivating and zestful performance. Our preparation for NOX-NITE is rigorous and equally fun. The event is held in the Open Air Theater (OAT) of Thapar and the entire venue is bustling with an eager, inquisitive and impressed audience. 
Through the years we have stumbled, fallen and eventually risen to make a name for ourselves taking these small steps. We train in western dance styles ranging from Waacking, Breaking, Locking till Bollywood and old school hip-hop. We incorporate this diversity in many routines and are always keen to learn more.
NOX takes strength and motivation from its hardworking members, be it the newbies who are filled with excitement and enthusiasm and put in all they have for the team or be it the seniors who have been a part of this journey for long now.
Professional Dancers and choreographers visit our society and train us to improvise our talent and perform in our best form. We also have workshops conducted by professionals which enhance our skills and equip us to perform better every time.
“Work Hard, Play Hard” 
You surely must have heard this a lot! But NOX is where you get to feel it. We may practice and rehearse like beasts but when we come down to having fun, there’s no place better.
While odd semesters are about competing at various places, various fests; a trip in every even semester refurbishes the team’s spirit and etches beautifully fun memories. Trips no longer just remain about visiting places, they become lifelong souvenirs, shared with a family of equally passionate people, full of memories of footsteps dancing around roads in unison. 
It’s your time to witness this passion and engage in something that moulds your confidence and shapes your will to stop at nothing less than perfection!
To be a member of NOX it’s not your dancing experience or expertise that counts but your readiness to learn with us. We learn together and grow together. If dance is the hidden language of your soul, make sure you don’t miss the auditions and you give yourself a chance to be a part of the NOX family.
