            <div class="society-des lead text-light">If you know Thapar, you have got to know NOX-Western Dance Society of Thapar University, established in 2007. The society actively participates in college fests held throughout India and performs for the major events held within the college as well. Some of our achievements include: 
• MOOD INDIGO, IIT BOMBAY (2019): Runner Ups 
• OASIS, BITS PILANI (2019): Winner 
• PECFEST (2019): Winner 
• ZEITGEIST, IIT ROPAR (2018): Winner 
• ALGORYTHM, CHITKARA (2018): Winner 
• PECFEST (2018): Runners up and many more……. 
A strong dynamic team of dancers on stage and a close-knit family offstage. We train in western dance styles ranging from Waacking, Breaking, Locking to Bollywood and old school hip-hop. NOX takes strength and hard work from its members, be it the newbies who are filled with excitement or be it the seniors who have been a part of this journey for long now. Professional Dancers and choreographers visit our society and train us and perform in our best form besides workshops conducted by professionals regularly. “Work Hard, Play Hard” is justified in NOX. While odd semesters are about competing at various places, various fests; a trip in every even semester refurbishes the team’s spirit and etches beautifully fun memories. .Apart from participation in events outside college NOX holds its annual event 'NOX-NITE', in February . To be a member of NOX it’s not your dancing experience or expertise that counts but your readiness to learn with us. We learn together and grow together and believe that “once a NOXian always a NOXian” . It’s your time to witness this passion and engage in something that moulds your confidence and shapes your will to stop at nothing less than perfection! If dance is the hidden language of your soul, make sure you do not miss the auditions and you give yourself a chance to be a part of the NOX family.</div>
