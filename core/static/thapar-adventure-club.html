                                                           -Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani

These are not just mere lines but they describe the feelings of every budding soul. Many of us had also started travelling after watching movies like Yeh Jawaani Hai Dewaani, Zindagi na Milegi Dobara, Dil Chahta Hai etc. Thapar Adventure Club is a platform for travel enthusiasts and those who love Adventure. Our aim is to promote travelling and conduct adventure activities for the students of our Institute.
The prime focus of the society is trekking, hiking, climbing, and trips to the different regions of India and to encourage every travel enthusiast. The club organizes treks (only for club members) in the Himachal and Uttarakhand regions, catering to the travel amateurs as well as professionals. Along with treks, trips are also organized in different states of India. We’ve organized many trips to Udaipur, Manali, Tirthan Valley, Bir billing, Jaisalmer, Rishikesh and treks of easy-moderate level.
The club aims to inspire students to go beyond their perceived limits, develop self-reliance, self-discipline, and teamwork. Activities like trekking, camping, rock climbing that focus on nurturing the ability to plan, organize and take decisions, and foster time management and problem-solving are organised regularly. Here in Adventure Club, you learn from scratch on how to plan any trip for a given number of people.
The best thing about Adventure Club is that we do not have formalities. We do not greet our seniors as ‘Sir/Mam’. We share our slightest of feelings because we know that nobody will judge here. We do not have a lot of work pressure so that our studies remain unaffected. We do not organise a lot of meetings like other societies to hamper your time. 
PERKS of being in our Club:
1. The treks are planned only for the members of our Club.
2. The trips also have a limited number of seats. Although trips are open for all, the priority is given to the Club members.
3. The Adventure Club collaborates with the Indian Institute of Skiing & Mountaineering (IISM), Gulmarg. We provide you with the opportunity to do a Basic Skiing Course in Gulmarg(Kashmir) or Auli(Uttarakhand). 
4. You get to know a lot of fellow travellers and you can plan an unofficial trip with them.
5. We have a party after every successful trip and an annual party to give a farewell to our seniors. Well, to be frank, all our trips/treks are not less than any party.
6. The cost of our treks/trips is a lot cheaper (roughly 50%) than other Organisations.
7. There is no other society which plans and executes trips and treks.

In the end, College life is not just about books but also for making memories for life. The trips and adventure with your squad are dreams for most of the teenagers. We would love to have you guys in our family and hope that you guys enjoy your best days in Thapar Institute Of Engineering and Technology. Best of Luck!</div>
