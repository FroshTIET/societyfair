            <p class="society-des lead text-light">MSC has grown from a society to a family over the years, not out of blood, but out of a common objective to achieve immeasurable excellence in life & inspire young minds. 
MSC as a family, is on a journey to procure limitless glory & a bag full of memories.
Our last session was full of extraordinary experiences and remarkable events as follows. It all started from the Techmeet where enthusiasts spoke about the field they were exploring at present and also shared their ideas and projects corresponding to it. The seniors shared their journey in college which turned out to be a great learning ordeal for everyone. 
MSC always witnessed and appreciated the willingness to learn. However, with an abundance of information out there, it can get tricky to comprehend new technology. Keeping that in mind , an ML workshop was conducted by Dr. P.S. Rana encircling the basics as well as project ideas. It was a fun , interactive session that provided a head start for people willing to explore ML. 
Game of codes was yet another fascinating event administered in multiple rounds. It was the perfect niche to learn and grow for coding enthusiasts. 
One of the biggest hit of the last session would undoubtedly be the Open source meet-up. It was graced by the presence of Aman Dhattarwal, a beloved YouTuber, speaker, and guide for thousands. The enthusiasm was beyond anyone could have anticipated and rightly so. It was incredibly informative and guided the students to make the best of their college life. 
An idea consisting of coding and logical reasoning resulted into the event named Sherlocked which had multiple rounds and challenged the participants in intriguing ways. 
Makeathon is undoubtedly one such event which everyone eagerly waits for. It’s a beautiful blend of innovation , creativity and skills. Multiple institutions participated and gave us the opportunity to witness all kinds of technologies .The winners did not only end up winning exciting prizes but also got an internship opportunity. 
The placement season facilitates the emergence of numerous questions regarding DSA and  placement related queries in students. To answer them , a placement drive was conducted in collaboration with Coding Blocks where students figured out what was needed to grab a good placement. 
A React JS workshop was conducted to spread awareness about its utility and to encourage more enthusiasts to dwell in this field. Mr Tathagat Thaplival graciously conducted the workshop and witnessed over 1800 learners. 
Lastly , the event which was an amalgamation of trading , technology and logical aptitude stunned many with its uniqueness and creativity. Relating to the real world , Abhyudaya had numerous crisis situations and had corresponding questions to avert the disaster. It was a never seen before experience and won the hearts of many. 
With every event , we strive to be even more creative , innovative and efficient than ever before. It’s a family where people thrive off of ideas and learning. We’ve only grown with time and hope to conquer unconquerable heights in the future as well.</p>
