- Linus Torvalds( Creator of Linux Kernel)

Today is the age of computer science. It is the age of creators and developers, people with real-life problem-solving skills, and people who want their works to affect the lives of millions and billions. With the advent of this new age, the senile custom of learning theoretically and waiting for a chance to apply, which never comes, needs to change.

After learning or exploring a particular skill set, the next most challenging job is finding great projects on that technology stack, something that shines on your resume. Because at the end of 4 years here at college, that is what's going to matter.

Break the wheel and become a part of something worth investing your time in. Get equipped with the skills that will help you be ahead of others in the industry. Do projects that will make your resume outshine. Become the part of a society that believes in collaboration and growing together. We don’t work to impress, we work to express, we don’t  work to show the college how good a society it is , but we work for  the family, the society itself ,what all can we do for anyone who is a part of it.
We focus our energies and resources on the things worth investing in. 
With round the year on-going industry level projects, guest lectures, some of the best-organized competitions, and brilliant alumni, LUG stands out from this plethora of monotonic societal culture here in Thapar.
With a fantastic set of mentors who know what they are doing, you get access to one of the most select groups of people you can reach out to for guidance.


Don't limit yourself to the pit of course-doers instead get to apply that knowledge to build something different, something that will impact the lives of people.

Since LUG is a collaborative community spread worldwide, get a chance to network with people from various places and fields. With us, there is no more roaming around aimlessly and no more beating around the bush. Become an essential part of something great.So it's time guys, the society is again opening its hands to anyone who wants to be a part of it, to anyone who can show his worth ,dedication and will to be anonymous but still the greatest. And I think that's only how a society is created, it's not created for the benefit of masses but for the benefit of the people who put in their efforts for the society.</p>
