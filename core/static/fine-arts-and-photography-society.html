FINE ARTS AND PHOTOGRAPHY SOCIETY
WHAT IS F.A.P.S ?!

Fine Arts and Photography Society is a collection of creative minds seeking a learning platform to implement their talent and put their vision to work. It is a place to showcase your talent, explore and learn new art forms while making memories and bonds to cherish for a lifetime, through various events over the year.

•	Halloween 
Before everyone breaks for winter vacation, we hold “ The Devil’s Own”, to showcase the creative and happening side of the members, through exciting games, face painting booths, and the main attraction.
•	Kaleidoscope – A Plethora of Art 
Kaleidoscope (THE HEART OF FINE ARTS AND PHOTOGRAPHY SOCIETY) is the Annual Art and Photography Exhibition of all the best works of the most creative minds of TIET. The theme-based arts and photographs, hues, that blend together to make an impression beyond words, is visited by the faculty and students of TIET.  
•	Workshops 
Want to try a new art form? We got you covered. Workshops are conducted in various art styles, where anyone willing can join to learn and explore their creative side. 
Sketching
The workshop introduces different styles of sketching, provides knowledge about pencils, inks, lighting and figures and gives a firsthand experience in to sketching out artworks. 
Soft pastels
Soft pastels, despite being an underrated medium, have a distinct vivid color tones and add depth to the artworks. The workshop explains different ways of handling and using soft pastels, and techniques to bring out the best in their composition. 
Painting
Starting from the basics of painting, use of water and colors, the workshop gives a firsthand experience in using various techniques, tips and knowledge to create the exquisite paintings you envisioned. 
Hand lettering
Hand lettering is essentially drawing letters; it is different from calligraphy, as here the focus is on the basic strokes to form letters and words. The participants are introduced to the techniques of styling write-ups, structure of strokes, color composition . 
Photography
The workshop empowers it’s attendees with the basics of photography with ISO, Shutter speed and Exposure, and basic composition. An in depth view on perspective and night photography, followed by concepts of editing and post correction, with applications such as Light room and Photoshop are covered. 
•	Competitions
A series of online competitions were held on our Facebook page. The participants created masterpieces, pictures of which they submitted on our Facebook page. Half the points were based on the creativity and quality of the work, the other half came from the number of likes and shares of the artwork. 

•	Wall Painting
One wall, each year, becomes our canvas. Need we say more? The last wall was a redesigned take on “The Starry Night” by Vincent Van Gogh. The painting kept intact the emotions “comfort in times of dimness” as some conclude, of the original piece, while introducing original elements unique to the members of the society.
