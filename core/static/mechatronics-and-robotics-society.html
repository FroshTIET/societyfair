            <p class="society-des lead text-light">“Will robots inherit the earth? Yes, but they will be our children.” -Marvin Minsky

It’s indeed true, Just like a human child is the product of our genes, intelligent machines are the product of our minds. We can build new children(robots) who are more suited for the new conditions.
We are the robotics club of Thapar Institute, comprising students from Mechatronics, Mechanical, Electronics, Electrical, and Computer Science streams focused at developing our skills and contributing to robotics culture in T.I.E.T, Patiala.
We aim to be the supporting hand for beginners and launchpad for the ˈwänəbē (adj.) experts, the fly high robotics and automation enthusiasts. Common interest driven intra-college community sharing resources for common gains.

We primarily work on technologies like, but not limited to, Microcontrollers, CAD Modelling, Gazebo simulation, ROS, Power electronics, Raspberry pi. Weekly meetings are held to assess and discuss each other’s progress or discuss an ongoing project. We also work on multiple platforms (like Windows, Linux). 
Members conduct workshops to impart all this knowledge to the best of their expertise. So you have the opportunity to grow in multiple fields which gives you an enormous knowledge base while being expert in one.

Our focus is not just on imparting technical knowledge but also to cultivate you to innovate and step up the game. Here you not only have the opportunity to work in a team composed of like minded peers, but also to lead them. 
Working individually on a multidisciplinary field like robotics is a very inefficient and time consuming work, hence a team of people working on different fields of engineering is necessary to make a robotics project possible.
Good alumni network also ensures guidance in reference to the current industry. 

So here at MARS we await all who want to grow and lead into the future.
