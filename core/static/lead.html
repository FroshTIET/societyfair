            <p class="society-des lead text-light">Not every journey has a predefined path. It's through inquisitive, meticulous analysis, and looking at opportunities via innovative approaches that we, at LEAD, have always mapped our path. Springing out from SCIMATICS, which consolidates Science and Mathematics, we at TIET started 5 years ago. Since then we have been igniting a spark in students to set new benchmarks in the technical, professional, and various multidisciplinary domains, and have never looked back till date. To add emphasis to the purpose we were serving and hence to add oil to the spark we ignited, we commenced our 'mentor-learner' program, which endeavored to help each other exchange ideas and skills, further helping us to reciprocate and grow together. 
We hence stood by and justified the abbreviation of what LEAD stands for. 
Learn.Emerge.Aspire.Discover.
Ascertaining to our aim, we have always been embedding our best, to come up with the mentor-learner program and taking into consideration domains that vary from technical to designing, from research to innovation, from non-technical disciplines involving Resume building to personality development hacks to emphasis on topics like preparation for interviews and which preferences to make. Our members have conquered their concerned departments by Emerging as true Leaders. Our team has been Aspiring each day to accomplish new advancements and to make a difference. Furthermore, we discover new ideas that can transform the professionally, technically, and digitally to as much extent as possible.  
Still, we consider our journey as incomplete until we authenticate ourselves as first thought for any student who is looking for a competent mentor. We are progressing towards our aim every day, are you? Join us on this exciting journey. Be it robotics, web development, app development, mathematics, anything in your learning bucket. We are there for you!</p>
