            <p class="society-des lead text-light">The Open Web Application Security Project(OWASP) Student Chapter is an elite technical society of the Thapar Institute of Engineering and Technology, Patiala. With an experience of over five years, we aim to spread our mission of collective learning to every nook and corner. By successfully organising many Hackathons, Tech talks, Workshops and Coding nights, we have always strived hard to maintain the coding culture throughout the campus. 
 
The inception of the last session was with “Techniti” which helped in spreading massive technical awareness among the freshers. This was followed by our main event, HACKOWASP 2.0, which focused on bringing out innovation in collaboration with various startups and organisations. About 400 young minds from 20+ different colleges all over India participated in the event. 
 
In the last session, we have also achieved great heights in the non-tech skills of our members. So, in addition to advancing the technical skills, we also focus on spreading apt knowledge of fields like marketing, finance, designing, content writing etc.

Our vision is to bring out the best of every individual. We capture young minds and introduce them to various fields. So, we are proposing both technical and non-tech workshops. This will help students to decide what they want to do and also give a clear picture of what interests them.</p>
