            <p class="society-des lead text-light">Thapar Amateur Astronomy Society(TAAS) as the name suggests is a society about meaningless group discussions with people who daydream about being an astronaut in a parallel universe. I’m kidding, we’re all into astronomy and astrophysics, and our hearts throb with passion when we look up.
Talking about parallel universes, do you think they exist? If they do, what do you think they’d be like? A multiverse where each instance is unique and in a way, similar as well. Different versions of the same you spanning across an array of infinite universes. Hold on a second, did we just assume that life is omnipresent. Maybe it is not, maybe, it is really scarce and maybe, just hear me out, maybe it is only present in this one. The mere feeling of imagining such an existence can be a fun way to spend your lectures in college, however horrifying it may be. 
“Imagination is everything. It is the preview of life’s coming attractions”. The guy who said that later came to be known as one of the most important scientists of all time, not because of the quote obviously, but for discovering the photoelectric effect which forms the basis of solar energy which is leading the idea for a sustainable world. Developments in the field of astronomy affect our daily lives a lot more than we usually realize. And we’re more than just insightful group discussions. 
In the odd semester, we have our college oriented event- ‘Eureka’, with professors from renowned institutions telling us about Black holes, X-ray telescopes, special relativity and magnetic universe. Believe me when I say, these lectures are not something you’d want to miss. 
Sometimes, we’d go on industrial trips to SCL, Mohali or the ARIES observatory or on a failed night-out to spot a few shooting stars during a meteor shower(IN THE MIDDLE OF EST’S).
And in the even semester, we organize space-games, quizzes, and other competitions for our college mates as well as the school students of Patiala in ‘Aakash-Ganga’, which usually spans over a couple of days. The aim is to spread the love for astronomy and space, among our members and the broader sections of the society. 
Afterall, life’s meaning eventually narrows down to the people around us. And that’s something we’re really proud of, that our members come from diverse branches, from electronics, to biomedical; from 1st years to the alumni who’ve left us 2 years ago and are still connected to us.   
And lastly, we go on a stargazing trip to some remote hill station with a hope to catch a glimpse of the beautiful and the glorious starry night that our ancestors were used to seeing almost every day.
Only if there was a parallel universe where metropolitan cities had no light pollution. *sighs* I wish.
Coming back to parallel universes, if they do exist, there must be one instance where you’d become a part of TAAS. 
Or do you think it’s this one? Then what are you waiting for?
